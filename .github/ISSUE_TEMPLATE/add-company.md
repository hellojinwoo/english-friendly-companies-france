**Details**

Describe in detail how English is used at this company:

I worked at Ledger from 2021 to 2023 as a software engineer. The company operates entirely in English - all internal documentation, code reviews, Slack communications, and meetings are conducted in English. The company has a very international team with employees from over 30 countries.
All job postings are published in English first, and the interview process is conducted entirely in English. You can see their current openings at https://jobs.lever.co/ledger - notice how everything is in English.

**Additional Comments**

While French language skills are appreciated for social interactions, they are not required for work. Many employees, including some in leadership positions, don't speak French at all.
