### Company Information Accuracy

When adding a company, please ensure:
- 🔍 The company name is spelled correctly (check their official website)

### What Counts as "English-Friendly"?

A company qualifies if:
- Daily meetings are conducted in English
- Internal documentation is in English

### What Doesn't Count?

Companies that:
